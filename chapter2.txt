  "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
  men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the charms of pleasure of the
   moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and
    trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame belongs to those who 
    fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as 
    saying through shrinking from toil and pain. These cases are perfectly
     simple and easy to distinguish. In a free hour, when our power of 
     choice is untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do
      what we like best, every pleasure is to be welcomed and every pain 
      avoided. But in certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty
       or the obligations of business it will frequently occur that 
       pleasures have to be repudiated and annoyances accepted. The wise 
       man therefore always holds in these matters to this principle of 
       selection: he rejects pleasures to secure other greater pleasures, 
       or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
